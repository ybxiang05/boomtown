## Personal Learnings

- Databases are like warehouses, and Apollo Server is a retrieval system - the schema serves as a blueprint of how the warehouse is organized, and resolvers are the carts that navigate through different parts of the warehouse to retrieve the necessary information. It is crucial to have a clear and logical schema as well as an understanding of how to navigate through the schema
- Destructuring is useful for breaking down objects in order to access the necessary information and only the necessary information
